While I am using Pandas to sort and manipulate my data, I will be using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize any relations I would like to highlight a few of the many possibly influential streaming platform factors on American colloquialism. I will be using Numpy to produce statistical information of my datasets that support my stance and visualizations. In addition to utilizing scikit- learn for producing general algorithms, I will implement BernoulliNB to generate my Naive Bayes algortihm.\n"
