As the prevalence of daily technological usage grows, streaming platforms continue to permeate the infrastructure of societal pastimes. Music streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify, as well as streaming services such as Hulu and Netflix, are becoming increasingly popular due to providing a plethora of entertainment at one’s fingertips. Due to this distinctive growth in an array of highly- accessible media, a desire to cater to individual consumers– and a desire by consumers to be presented with more specialized content– is also increasing. Inspired by works already implemented, my project aims to examine if the self- reported happiness level of a person in the past- year will have a significant impact on their media consumption preferences today.

### Media

Media consumption being tied to emotional state is not a new topic. One study in 1988 used factor analysis on a group of one hundred American students attending university to gauge their reasons for attending movie theaters and the preferences for the movies they watch. The three main reasons consisted of intentional escapism, desires of self improvement, and genuine entertainment. However, even more insightful, was the researchers being able to make out that the movie theater attendees who went for escapism, “preferred movies with an air of unreality” (@doi:10.1080/00223980.1988.10542949). This illustrates how consumers desire to see a part of themselves– or a part they hope to gain– in the various things they consume. 

Taking a more comprehensive approach to present a complementary notion, a more recent study explores how instrumental considering the emotional state of the consumer is to media recommendation. Winoto and Yang (2010) had seventy- seven college students in the midst of final exams’ season participate in their experiment, where they answered questions revolving around 46 movies and 16 sentiment labels. This study yielded insights such as possessing positive- affect and negative- affect have a significant effect on the rating of romantic- comedy movies. Another takeaway is the observation that user recommendation systems may not be as successful when the said user is, “not in the mood to enjoy a movie” (@WINOTO20106086). Taking into account physical exhaustion levels and general mood, the study demonstrates just a fraction of how specific the external and internal influences can be on increasing the bias which affects media consumption preferences.
